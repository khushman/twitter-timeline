What should our basic design be?
A replica of the facebook timeline?

I think a horizontal bar, with small thumbnails for posts, which can then be expanded will be better. That way, even if a user has a large number of posts, it won't be a problem. Plus atleast i'm bored of the vertical timeline.
This will have a left or right navigation based on the tweet times in descending order.

Plus, we'll be using HTML5 and CSS3, so apart from FF, Chrome & Safari, we don't worry about design compatibility, right?

Horizontal line would be a great idea, we can do a vertical/horizontal line. Vertical line is bring a feel of the old timeline so that peopl will get comfortable 
and Horizontal line would be something new. But the thing is how are we going to show the posts in Horizontal timeline?
